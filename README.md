# Cybersecurity Learning Log

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Learning Log!  
This repository documents my journey from foundational cybersecurity skills to advanced topics such as penetration testing, defensive security, and cloud security.

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity at Linköping University, Sweden, and this repo serves as both a personal learning diary and a public portfolio of my progress.
